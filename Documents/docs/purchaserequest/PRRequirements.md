# Purchase Request UI Requirements

## Overview
The Purchase Request (PR) UI is a crucial component of our procurement system, allowing users to create, view, edit, and manage purchase requests efficiently. This document outlines the requirements for both the frontend and backend components of the PR UI.

## Frontend Requirements

### 1. Purchase Request List View
- Display a list of all purchase requests with key information:
  - PR number
  - Date
  - Requestor
  - Department
  - Total amount
  - Status
- Implement sorting and filtering options for all columns
- Include a search functionality to find specific PRs
- Provide pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets
- Allow bulk actions (e.g., approve, reject, delete) for selected PRs

### 2. Purchase Request Detail View
- Show comprehensive information about a single PR:
  - Header with PR number, status, and key details
  - Tabs for different sections:
    - Items (list of requested items)
    - General Info (requestor details, dates, etc.)
    - Financial Details (budget information, cost centers)
    - Attachments & Comments
    - Approval Workflow
    - Activity Log
- Implement edit functionality for authorized users
- Display status changes and approval workflow visually

### 3. Create/Edit Purchase Request Form
- Multi-step form with sections for:
  - Basic PR information (date, type, description)
  - Requestor details
  - Item list (with ability to add, edit, remove items)
  - Budget allocation
  - Attachments upload
- Implement form validation and error handling
- Allow saving as draft and submission
- Provide a preview mode before final submission

### 4. Item Management within PR
- List view of items with inline editing capabilities
- Modal or slide-out panel for detailed item view/edit
- Quick add functionality for new items
- Ability to import items from a template or previous PR

### 5. Approval Workflow UI
- Visual representation of the approval chain
- Action buttons for approvers (approve, reject, request changes)
- Comment section for each approval step
- Notification system for pending approvals and status changes

### 6. Dashboard for PR Overview
- Summary statistics (total PRs, pending approvals, etc.)
- Charts and graphs for PR trends and budget utilization
- Quick access to recent or important PRs

### 7. Mobile Responsiveness
- Ensure all views are fully functional on mobile devices
- Optimize layouts for smaller screens

## Backend Requirements

### 1. API Endpoints
- Create RESTful API endpoints for:
  - CRUD operations on Purchase Requests
  - CRUD operations on PR Items
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Approval workflow actions
  - File upload and management for attachments
  - Search and filter functionality

### 2. Database Schema
- Design and implement database schema for:
  - Purchase Requests
  - PR Items
  - Users and Roles
  - Departments and Cost Centers
  - Approval Workflows
  - Activity Logs

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Secure all API endpoints with proper authorization checks

### 4. Business Logic Implementation
- Implement logic for:
  - PR number generation
  - Status changes based on workflow
  - Budget checks and validations
  - Approval routing based on amount thresholds and department rules

### 5. Integration with Other Systems
- Develop interfaces for integration with:
  - Accounting/ERP system for budget checks
  - Inventory management system for item details
  - User directory (e.g., Active Directory) for user information

### 6. Notification System
- Implement email notifications for:
  - PR status changes
  - Pending approvals
  - Approaching deadlines

### 7. Reporting and Analytics
- Create backend services to generate:
  - PR summary reports
  - Budget utilization reports
  - Approval time analytics

### 8. Data Validation and Sanitization
- Implement robust input validation on all API endpoints
- Sanitize data to prevent XSS and injection attacks

### 9. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive logging for all PR activities
- Set up monitoring for system health and performance

### 10. Data Export
- Provide functionality to export PR data in various formats (CSV, PDF)

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance: The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds for most operations.
2. Scalability: Design the backend to be horizontally scalable to accommodate growth.
3. Security: Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit. Conduct regular security audits.
4. Availability: Aim for 99.9% uptime for the PR system.
5. Compliance: Ensure the system adheres to relevant procurement and data protection regulations.

## Future Considerations

1. Implementation of machine learning for PR approval recommendations
2. Integration with blockchain for enhanced traceability of the procurement process
3. Development of a mobile app for on-the-go PR management
